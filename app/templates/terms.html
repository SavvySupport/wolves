      	Terms of Purchase and Redemption
          Savvy Hire resells products and services on behalf of our sellers. In some instances the seller may require you to accept the seller's terms and conditions to be able to access and/or use the products and services. By purchasing these offers, you agree to the following general terms and conditions:

                               Once you have made a purchase, the order is redeemable only by you from the seller stated on the Tax Invoice. The order must be redeemed within the period of validity. Expired orders are non-refundable in whole or part. Any attempted redemption not in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the seller's specific terms and conditions on the offer will render the order null and void.

                               We do not act as an agent for the seller. The seller will be responsible for complying with all applicable laws relating to supply of the product or services and shall be responsible for injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities, loss and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the seller, as well as for any unclaimed liability arising from unredeemed orders. Savvy Hire does not control any sellers, and is not responsible for any such injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities or costs.

                               Neither Savvy Hire nor the seller is liable for any lost or stolen Tax Invoices.

                               Orders cannot be reproduced, resold, traded. Any attempt to conduct these activities is considered as a breach of this Agreement and will render the order null and void.

                               The order can only be redeemed in its entirety for the purchased items.

                               Subject to the Refunds and Exchanges policy below, all orders are final and cannot be cancelled (for whatever reason) or redeemed for cash or exchanged for other offers.

      	Refunds and Exchanges on Purchases
           This Policy sets out the circumstances in which Savvy Hire may provide you with a refund:


                          Automatic Refunds

                          Savvy Hire will provide an automatic refund where:
                               We have made a mistake in advertising an offer that fundamentally misrepresents the product or service; or
                               You are not provided with the products or services by the seller that you should have received pursuant to the terms of the offer, including circumstances where a seller ceases to trade and enters bankruptcy or liquidation (as relevant).

                          Non-Refundable Circumstances
                          The following circumstances DO NOT qualify for refunds:

                               Where you have failed to read the Specific Terms and Conditions of the offer and the General Terms and Conditions; or
                               If you lose or misplace or do not present the Tax Invoice on redemption of service; or
                               If you fail to redeem the order before it is expired for any reason; or
                               If you cancel a scheduled appointment such that the cancellation voids the order in accordance with the seller's cancellation policy; or
                               If you are late for your booking, and the seller decides to cancel your order; or
                               If any issues arise with the seller or the supply of the product / service in the order (for whatever reason). You must take the issue up directly with the seller.

                          Submitting a request for a Refund
                          A request for a refund must be submitted via email to weiyew@savvysme.com.au with the words 'REQUEST FOR REFUND' in the Subject header.


                         All members requesting a Refund will be required to provide a full account of their experience with the product and/or service and full particulars as to (a) why they are not satisfied with the quality of the product and services that are the subject of the order, and/or (b) why they are not satisfied that the product or services provided by a seller conformed with the terms and conditions for that offer and/or (c) the circumstances surrounding the seller not providing the product or services that should have been provided pursuant to the terms of the offer ("Particulars").

                          You agree to not dispute or otherwise seek a "chargeback" from the company whose credit card you used. At all times, you further agree not to discuss the refund with anyone else other than the staff of Savvy Hire and the seller of the offer without express written permission of Savvy Hire.


                         Savvy Hire reserves the right to verify the validity and veracity of some or all of the Particulars at any time, including (but not limited to) by consulting with the relevant seller responsible for fulfillment of the offer and/or by asking the member for additional information.


                          Savvy Hire may refuse the request for refund if in our absolute discretion, believe the request does not comply with this Agreement or the seller's specific terms and conditions or if the request is misleading, deceptive or incorrect. Furthermore, any fraudulent refund requests will be immediately referred to the relevant authorities.


                          Savvy Hire is under no obligation to provide you with reasons as to why your request has been refused.

                          Where Savvy Hire provides a refund, the value of the refund will be the same as the purchase amount of the corresponding offer. Any refund provided by Savvy Hire is in no way an admission of liability by or on behalf of Savvy Hire.

      	Changes
          Savvy Hire reserves the right to change, alter or amend this Agreement at any time.

      	Entire Agreement
           These Terms constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

      	Severability
           If any term or provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement will not be affected.

      	Waiver
          Either party's failure to exercise any of its rights under this agreement will not constitute or be deemed to constitute a waiver or forfeiture of such rights.

      	Applicable Law
          This Agreement is made under and will be construed in accordance
                          with the laws of the State of New South Wales, Australia, and each
                          party will submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that
                          state.
